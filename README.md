This is the website for Team Stingray, a group of game dev students in Sydney, Australia. Its currently a work in progress but once its setup we'll be using it to display our projects and members!

Tech this website is/will be using:
- Next.js: react framework
- Vercel: hosting
- Supabase*: project/blog data backend

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` 
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

Vercel automatically deploys whatever is on `main` to https://teamstingray.dev
